1. Understand the business problem. (Spend some time on understanding what is good result)
1.5 Benchmark
2. Gather as much as data(features) as possible unless really makes no sense
3. Do feature engineering and transformations to get one table with one row per observation. (Use features that beeline already has and try featuretools library)
4. If classification use Catboost, if regression use Ngboost or Catboost as algorithm. Train model.
5. Choose features that are important. Use feature importance or permutation importance, or SHAP.
6. Tune. Save best model.
7. Work on predict pipe
8. Wrap everything into docker.
9. Push to prod.
